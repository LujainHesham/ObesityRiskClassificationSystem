## 🎓 Project Overview
This machine learning classification system was developed as our capstone project for the **ITIDA/NTI Machine Learning Summer Training 2024**, where we achieved a **99% final score**. The project implements a complete pipeline to classify individuals into 7 obesity risk levels based on lifestyle and physical condition data from three Latin American countries.

### Key Achievements
- **90.1% accuracy** with Random Forest classifier
- **Complete ML pipeline** from EDA to model deployment
- **5-classifier comparison** with detailed evaluation metrics
- **Team collaboration** demonstrating agile development practices
